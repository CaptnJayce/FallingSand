### Requirements:
Ensure you have [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/b) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) installed on your system

I recommend installing gcc via your package manager or with MinGW

### Running
Run the bash script with "bash build.bash" or compile directly:
```
g++ -lraylib main.cpp -o sands
./sands
```
